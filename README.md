**Welcome to the official companion repository for the "SOLID Principles in iOS" blog series.**

This repository contains real-world Swift examples demonstrating the transition from "Spaghetti Code" (Massive View Controllers, tight coupling) to clean, scalable, and testable **SOLID Architecture**.

> **"If you want to grow from a coder to a software engineer, SOLID is your foundation."**
